      Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenues grew 11.5% to cross ₹1.57 lakh crore
      in May. While this marks the slowest growth in six months, with
      collections 16% lower than April’s inflows, a nuanced reading is
      warranted. April’s revenues, which crossed a record ₹1.87 lakh crore, were
      bumped up by financial year-end compliances. Although May’s collections,
      for transactions during April, the first month of this financial year,
      were the lowest in three months, they signal a broader positive trend.
      While GST revenues have been over the ₹1.4 lakh mark for 15 successive
      months, May’s revenues mark only the sixth time that GST revenues have
      crossed the ₹1.5 lakh crore mark. Four of those occasions have been in
      2023. More significantly, even after discounting the April spurt, the
      average monthly revenues between October 2022 and May 2023 are over ₹1.53
      lakh crore (and ₹1.57 lakh crore-plus if April’s record kitty is
      included). Revenues have held up despite retail inflation cooling to 4.7%
      in April and wholesale prices slipping into deflation. Given this
      backdrop, if price rise continues to ease, 10%-12% growth rates in the GST
      kitty should be fine even if they seem more solemn than last year.
